# Changelog

All notable changes to the Advanced Markdown Chunker plugin will be documented in this file.

## [2.1.6] - 2026-01-06

### Added
- **Overlap Contract Tests** — Comprehensive tests for overlap behavior
  - Tests for `include_metadata=True`: overlap in metadata only
  - Tests for `include_metadata=False`: overlap embedded in content
  - Property-based tests using Hypothesis for overlap contract validation
  - Edge case tests (first chunk, last chunk)

- **Hierarchical Integration Tests** — Tests for hierarchical mode with chunkana 0.1.1
  - Tree invariant validation tests (`is_leaf` consistency, parent-child references)
  - Debug mode behavior tests
  - Chunk ID uniqueness tests

- **`leaf_only` parameter** — Return only leaf chunks in hierarchical mode
  - New tool parameter for vector database indexing optimization
  - Excludes internal nodes (sections with children) from output
  - Recommended for RAG systems where only content chunks are needed

- **`indexable` field** — Indicates if chunk should be indexed
  - Added to all chunks in hierarchical mode
  - Root chunk: `indexable=false`
  - All other chunks: `indexable=true`

- **OutputFilter component** — Filters hierarchical output for downstream consumers
  - Excludes root chunk by default (use `debug=true` to include)
  - Adds `indexable` field to metadata
  - Supports `leaf_only` filtering

- **InputValidator component** — Validates library output with sensible defaults
  - Sets `is_leaf=true` if missing (safe default for indexing)
  - Sets `is_root=false` if missing
  - Logs warnings for missing fields

- **Boundary invariance tests** (`tests/test_boundary_invariance.py`)
  - Tests that chunking is called exactly once
  - Tests that raw_chunks are identical regardless of include_metadata
  - Tests that boundaries are invariant to include_metadata
  - Tests for preamble separation in both modes
  - Tests for content coverage as line recall (≥95%)
  - Tests for validate_and_fix applied in both modes
  - Tests for indexable field handling

### Fixed
- **CHNK-CRIT-01: Unstable boundaries with include_metadata toggle**
  - Refactored adapter to separate chunking and rendering stages
  - `_perform_chunking()` does NOT depend on `include_metadata` parameter
  - `_render_chunks()` only formats output, does NOT modify boundaries

- **Upgraded to chunkana 0.1.3** — Critical fixes for chunking quality
  - SectionSplitter with header_stack repetition for oversize sections
  - InvariantValidator with recall-based coverage validation

  - Removed section_integrity oversize reason

- **OutputFilter improvements**
  - `_add_indexable_field()` now uses setdefault() — respects library value
  - `_filter_for_indexing()` uses `indexable` field, not just `is_leaf`
  - Non-leaf chunks with significant content (>100 chars) are now indexable

- **Removed render_with_embedded_overlap**

## [2.1.0] - 2025-12-07

### Added
- **List-Aware Strategy** — Intelligent chunking for list-heavy documents
  - Preserves nested list hierarchies (never splits across depth levels)
  - Automatically binds introduction paragraphs to their lists
  - Smart grouping of related list items based on structure
  - Handles bullet lists, numbered lists, and checkboxes
  - Activation logic: `list_ratio > 0.40 AND list_count >= 5` (for structured docs) or `list_ratio > 0.40 OR list_count >= 5` (for plain lists)
  - Perfect for changelogs, feature lists, task lists, and outlines
  - **Competitive advantage:** Unique capability not found in LangChain, LlamaIndex, Unstructured, or Chonkie

- **Adaptive Overlap Sizing** — Context window scales with chunk size
  - Replaced fixed `MAX_OVERLAP_CONTEXT_SIZE = 500` with adaptive ratio-based sizing
  - Formula: `min(config.overlap_size, chunk_size * 0.35)`
  - Small chunks respect configured `overlap_size`
  - Large chunks allow up to 35% overlap (e.g., 8KB chunk = up to 2.8KB overlap)
  - Prevents metadata bloat while providing sufficient context
  - Automatic scaling without manual tuning

### Changed
- **Configuration**: Added 2 new parameters for list-aware strategy
  - `list_ratio_threshold=0.40` — minimum ratio of list content to activate strategy
  - `list_count_threshold=5` — minimum number of list items to activate strategy
- **Architecture**: Total strategies increased from 3 to 4 (code_aware, structural, list_aware, fallback)
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README update highlighting competitive advantages
  - List-aware strategy prominently featured as unique capability
  - Practical examples for changelog processing
  - Updated architecture and configuration sections

### Fixed
- PEP 8 compliance: Fixed E203 linter errors (whitespace before ':' in slice notation)
- Code quality: All quality checks pass with 0 errors

### Testing
- Added comprehensive tests for adaptive overlap behavior
  - Test for large chunks (validates scaling works)
  - Test for small chunks (validates config limit still applies)
  - Test for proportional scaling comparison
- Created demonstration script `demo_adaptive_overlap.py`
- All 24 tests in `test_preamble_scenarios.py` pass

- Updated `README.md` - streamlined with references to other docs
- Updated `INSTALLATION.md` - installation instructions
- Updated `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - common issues and solutions
- Updated `PACKAGING.md` - packaging instructions

### Technical Details
- Analyzed official Dify plugins to understand correct format
- Confirmed that Dify automatically searches for icons in `_assets/` directory
- **Important:** CLI supports `.difyignore` file for excluding files from package
- `.gitignore` only affects git repository, `.difyignore` affects package contents
- Package size: 145 KB (compressed), 575 KB (uncompressed)
- Maximum package size: 50 MB (uncompressed)
- Excluded from package: tests, development docs, validation scripts, Python cache

### Migration Notes
